While a single, all-in-one GitHub repository that seamlessly automates the entire process of fetching research article references, generating a BibTeX file, and deploying a GitHub Pages site might not exist as a turnkey solution, you can achieve this by combining several powerful tools and plugins within the GitHub ecosystem.

The most robust approach involves using a Jekyll-based academic website template, a Jekyll plugin to fetch data from ORCID, and GitHub Actions to automate the updates and deployment. ORCID is generally recommended over Google Scholar for such automation due to its structured data and API-friendly nature.

Here's a breakdown of how you can set this up:

1. Choose an Academic Jekyll Theme:

These themes are designed for academics and often come with built-in support for displaying publications and pre-configured GitHub Actions for deployment. Popular choices include:

alshedivat/al-folio: A clean and responsive Jekyll theme for academic portfolios. It generates publication pages from a BibTeX file (typically _bibliography/papers.bib).
GitHub: https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio
academicpages/academicpages.github.io: A widely used Jekyll template for academic websites, also using a BibTeX file for publications.
GitHub: https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io
2. Use a Jekyll Plugin to Retrieve Publications from ORCID and Generate BibTeX:

This is the core of the automation for your publication list. The following plugin is designed for this:

MartinHinz/jekyll-orcid-bibtex: This Jekyll plugin fetches your publication data from your ORCID profile and writes it to a BibTeX file (e.g., _bibliography/orcid.bib or another configurable path). This file can then be used by your Jekyll theme to display the publications.
GitHub: https://github.com/MartinHinz/jekyll-orcid-bibtex
How it works: You add this plugin to your Jekyll site's _plugins directory and configure your ORCID ID in the _config.yml file. When Jekyll builds your site, this plugin should ideally fetch the latest data from ORCID and update the BibTeX file.
3. Integrate the Plugin with Your Chosen Theme:

Install the jekyll-orcid-bibtex plugin as per its documentation.
Configure your Jekyll theme (e.g., al-folio or academicpages) to read the BibTeX file generated by the plugin. This might involve specifying the path to the BibTeX file in the _config.yml if it's different from the theme's default.
Ensure the theme uses a tool like jekyll-scholar to process the BibTeX file and render your publications list on a page.
4. Automate with GitHub Actions:

GitHub Actions can automate the process of building and deploying your Jekyll site (including the publication list updates).

Existing Workflows: Most academic Jekyll themes like al-folio and academicpages already come with a .github/workflows/deploy.yml (or similar) file that sets up a GitHub Action. This action typically triggers on pushes to your main branch, builds the Jekyll site, and deploys it to the gh-pages branch, making it live.
How the ORCID plugin fits in: Because the jekyll-orcid-bibtex plugin is a Jekyll plugin, it should run during the Jekyll build step of the GitHub Action. This means each time the Action runs, the plugin should fetch the latest publications from ORCID, update the BibTeX file, and then Jekyll will build the site with this updated list.
Scheduled Updates (Optional but Recommended): To ensure your publication list is regularly updated without requiring you to manually push changes to the repository, you can add a schedule trigger to your GitHub Actions workflow. For example, to run the workflow weekly:
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Or your default branch
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Runs every Sunday at midnight UTC
Alternative for BibTeX Generation (If not using a Jekyll plugin):

If you prefer not to use a Jekyll plugin or want to fetch from a source other than ORCID (like Google Scholar, though this is less reliable for automation), you could use standalone scripts:

MrPike/orcid-to-bibtex: A command-line tool to generate a BibTeX file from an ORCID record.
GitHub: https://github.com/MrPike/orcid-to-bibtex
FrancescoDiCursi/bibtex-google-scholar: A Python script to create/correct BibTeX files from Google Scholar.
GitHub: https://github.com/FrancescoDiCursi/bibtex-google-scholar
If using such scripts, your GitHub Action workflow would need an additional step before the jekyll build command:

Checkout your code.
Set up the script's environment (e.g., Python).
Run the script to fetch publications and generate/update your .bib file.
Commit the updated .bib file back to the repository (or ensure the build step uses the locally generated file).
Build and deploy the Jekyll site.
In Summary:

While there isn't a single repository that offers this as a one-click solution, the combination of:

An academic Jekyll theme (like al-folio or academicpages).
The MartinHinz/jekyll-orcid-bibtex Jekyll plugin for ORCID integration.
GitHub Actions (often pre-configured in the themes) for automated build and deployment.
provides a powerful and maintainable way to achieve your goal of an automatically updated publication list on a GitHub Pages site with a corresponding BibTeX file. Remember to keep your ORCID profile up-to-date, as it will be the source of truth for your publications.
